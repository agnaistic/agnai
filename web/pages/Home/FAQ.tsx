### Are my responses filtered?
No, Agnaistic does not make any attempt to filter your responses.

### The response from the character keeps getting cut off mid-sentence. What can I do?
There are a few things you can try:
- In your **Preset Settings** increase your \`Max Tokens\`.
- If you're using **Horde**, make sure your \`Max Tokens\` isn't "too high". In your **Settings -> Horde Settings** you can click \`Select Workers\` to view the "Context and Token" limits of each worker. Ensure your \`Max Tokens\` does not exceed their token limit.

### How can I have multiple profiles or change my name in the chat?
This is accomplished by **impersonating a character**. To impersonate, click on your Avatar/Name in the main menu.

### Can I have multiple users and characters in my chat?
Yes. In your **Chat Options**, you can add characters and invite users from **Participants**.

### Can I edit or delete my chat messages?
Yes. In the **Chat Options** enable *Chat Editing* and extra buttons will appear in your chat messages.

### My response was cut off mid-sentence, can I continue it?
Yes. In the **Input Options** you can choose to *Generate More*.

### Can I generate images based on my conversation?
Yes, you can configure image generation in your **Settings -> Image Settings**.
When you specify the Web URL, make sure it is *publicly accessible* using a service like Local Tunnel or NGrok.

### Do you support Text-to-Speech?
Yes, In your **Settings -> Voice Settings** we support a variety of text-to-speech services.

### Can I customise the UI?
Yes, you can change some elements of Agnaistic in your **Settings -> UI Settings**.

### I came from "some other site", how can I get my bot to talk like it was on that site?
All frontends behave a little differently. You can tweak how your character behaves by modifying your **Prompt Template** in your **Preset**.

### I forgot my password!
