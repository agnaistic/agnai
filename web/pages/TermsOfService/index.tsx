(d) Third Party Services. Any third party software, services, or other products you use in connection with the Services are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for third party products. This includes third party language models, generative tooling, and other systems which Services interface with.

## 3. Content

(a) Your Content. You may provide input to the Services ("Input"), and receive output generated and returned by the Services based on the Input ("Output"). Input and Output are collectively "Content." As between the parties and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the Stakeholders hereby assigns to you all its right, title and interest in and to Output. This means you can use Content for any purpose, including commercial purposes such as sale or publication, if you comply with these Terms. The Stakeholders may use Content to provide and maintain the Services, comply with applicable law, and enforce our policies. You are responsible for Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms.
(b) Similarity of Content. Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Services may generate the same or similar output for the Stakeholders or a third party. For example, you may provide input to a model such as "What color is the sky?" and receive output such as "The sky is blue." Other users may also ask similar questions and receive the same response. Responses that are requested by and generated for other users are not considered your Content.
(c) Use of Content to Improve Services. We reserve the right to use Content from Services to help develop and improve our Services. All content is subject to our Privacy Policy.
(d) Accuracy. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. You should evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case, including by using human review of the Output.
(e) Medical use. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are not qualified to provide medical advice or therapy. Stakeholders have taken reasonable measures to protect users; Stakeholders do not allow the use of Services for therapy or medical advice. Acceptance of these terms implies that you will use common sense and that you do not expect the content provided is superior to your own knowledge or the advice of medical professionals.

## 5. Fees and Payments

(a) Fees and Billing. The Stakeholders provide the majority of our Services to you at no charge.  In instances where Fees apply, you will pay all fees charged to your account (“Fees”) according to the prices and terms on the applicable pricing page, or as otherwise agreed between us in writing. We have the right to correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have already issued an invoice or received payment. You will provide complete and accurate billing information including a valid and authorized payment method. We will charge your payment method on an agreed-upon periodic basis, but may reasonably change the date on which the charge is posted. You authorize Stakeholders and our affiliates, and our third-party payment processor(s), to charge your payment method for the Fees. If your payment cannot be completed, we will provide you written notice and may suspend access to the Services until payment is received. Fees are payable in U.S. dollars and are due upon invoice issuance. Payments are nonrefundable except as provided in this Agreement.
(b) Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Fees do not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, and other similar assessments (“Taxes”). You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase, excluding Taxes based on our net income, and we may invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to timely pay such Taxes and provide us with documentation showing the payment, or additional evidence that we may reasonably require. Stakeholders use the name and address in your account registration as the place of supply for tax purposes, so you must keep this information accurate and up-to-date.
(c) Price Changes. We may change our prices by posting notice to your account and/or to our website. Price increases will be effective 14 days after they are posted, except for increases made for legal reasons or increases made to Beta Services (as defined in our Service Terms), which will be effective immediately. Any price changes will apply to the Fees charged to your account immediately after the effective date of the changes.

Undisputed amounts past due may be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month. If any amount of your Fees are past due, we may suspend your access to the Services after we provide you written notice of late payment.
(e) Free Tier. You may not create more than one account to benefit from credits provided in the free tier of the Services. If we believe you are not using the free tier in good faith, we may charge you standard fees or stop providing access to the Services.

If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your use of the Services, you must promptly contact Stakeholders and provide details of the vulnerability or breach.

We may terminate these Terms immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 4 (Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection), 7 (Dispute Resolution) or 8 (General Terms), if there are changes in relationships with third party technology providers outside of our control, or to comply with law or government requests. We may suspend your access to the Services if you do not comply with these Terms, if your use poses a security risk to us or any third party, or if we suspect that your use is fraudulent or could subject us or any third party to liability.
(b) Effect on Termination. Upon termination, you will stop using the Services and you will promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any Confidential Information.
