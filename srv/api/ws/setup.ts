 * @TODO - Set up optional message bus
 *
 * These sockets aren't connected to a message bus.
 * Therefore this architecture cannot scale horizontally until there is one in place.
 *
 * A message bus isn't required for self-hosting or small scale hosts.
 *
 * However a 'production grade' deployment would require something like Redis to handle
 * sockets distributed across several hosts or processes.
